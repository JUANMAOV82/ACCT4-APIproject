In this web page, I use three APIs, namely "board api", "nasa api" and "weather api"；

# BOARD API

The board api is the beginning of everything, triggered by a button. I first set participants=1 in the api (set as a project that can be carried out by one person). When the user clicks the "I'm bored" button, the api will automatically help him Generate an active project.

# NASA API

The nasa api cooperates with the weather api. The nasa api obtains a picture through the date, and the weather api provides weather information to the user. In my imagination, after the user obtains an event, he can check whether today's weather information is in time for the event. You will also get a picture representing today's activities.
