# Chatbot (UI part) PROJECT
I envisioned my discord bot as a very sleepy, passive bot, with most of its feedback based on using emojis to reply to users in the channel; and I wanted it to use specific emojis to express tiredness or disinterest. Or convey that style through the way it responds, such as using short, less-than-enthusiastic replies.
